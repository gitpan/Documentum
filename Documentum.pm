=head1 NAME

Documentum - Perl extension for Documentum Client Libraries.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Documentum;
	use Documentum qw(:all);

	$scalar = dmAPIInit();

	$string = dmAPIGet(<method>);
	$string = dmAPIGet("connect,docbase,username,password");

	$scalar = dmAPIExec(<method>);
	$scalar = dmAPIExec("create,current,dm_document");

	$scalar = dmAPISet(<method>,<value>);
	$scalar = dmAPISet("set,current,last,object_name","My Document");

	$scalar = dmAPIDeInit();


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<Documentum> module provides a perl5 modular interface to the 
client libraries for the Documentum Enterprise Document Management
System (EDMS).  You must have already obtained the necessary libraries and
purchased the necessary licenses from documentum before you can build
this module.  For more information on Documentum EDMS, see 
I<http://www.documentum.com/>

This module provides an interface to the five listed API functions
above.  For most purposes, these are the only functions you need to
use, as the bulk of the API is implemented as server methods accessed
by one of the API commands.  The API commands differ only in what
their return value is expected to be.  B<dmAPIExec> is expected to
return a scalar (1 or 0) which can be evaluated to determine success (1 for
success).  B<dmAPISet> also return a scalar, but takes two arguments,
the method argument and the value to use.  B<dmAPIGet> takes a single
argument and returns a string containing the results.  This string,
which may contain an object or query collection identifier can be used later 
with other method calls.

This module by default does not import all of its symbols into the calling
package's namespace.  Therefore, the Documentum API commands must be
called with the fully-qualified package path:

	Documentum::dmAPIGet

To use the module functions without having to supply the module name,
use the second form of the "use" statement shown above:

	use Documentum qw(:all);

That said, check your Documentum documentation for complete information
on how to interact with the Documentum server.

pay for.  Talk to Documentum about supporting a Perl interface. :-)
